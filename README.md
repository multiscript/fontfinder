# fontfinder
**fontfinder is a Python package for finding and installing fonts for Unicode scripts. It's useful
when generating documents that must specify a font family and will be viewed across multiple platforms.**
For now, `fontfinder` mostly locates fonts in the [Google Noto font collection](https://fonts.google.com/noto).
